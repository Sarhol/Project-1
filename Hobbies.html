<h2> I love to cook! </h2>
<p> my favorite things to cook are breads and pastries, but sometimes I make full meals </p>
<p> I almost went to school to become a pastry chef! Obviously I ended up not doing that though. </p>

<h2> Right now I'm reading 3 books. </h2>
<p> <i>The palace job </i> by patrick weekes </p>
<p><i>Unbound </i> by shaun speakman </p>
<p><i>Asunder </i> by david gaider </p>
<p> Can you tell I love fantasy? </p>

<h2> I also like to write short stories. I usually listen to music like this! </h2>
